Talk about a game of 2 halves that was unreal The massively better played back 9 really made me realise what a tough challenge this is for Bob He played really well I mean really well but still took 40 to finish the round That means if hed played the front 9 just as well it still wouldnt have been under 80 I really hope you succeed one day Bob but on most courses a 79 is what single digit handicappers are posting and with the best will in the World you arent a sub 10 handicap player Ill continue to cheer for you though and will continue to drink Fireball while watching you attempt this,0.265,0.698,0.037,0.9824

I like bob but I stopped watching Bob a while back That said bob has consistent golf game issues Below is a brief analysis of Bobs game 1 Driver Actually his best attribute Hits roughly 50 of fairways with his driver bad choices off the tee make this worse but its his best attribute most of the time 2 Longironsfairway woods from distance Bobby needs to stop pulling the big sticks even in scramble Hes got a big 0 fer on this one and Ive never seen a worthwhile shot Ruling Keep these in your bag except for par 3s 3 Mid irons approach shots or layups about average for his handicap estimated as 12 Better strategic choices and understanding how to plan for your misses will get you to the next level 4 Short irons Ummm practice this is where dear ole bobby can see the biggest improvement His short irons are below average for his handicap Very poor and no excuse 5 Chipping and pitching About average for his handicap No reason this cannot be improved If you are a zero handicap on chipping your handicap improves more than any other stat 6 Putting Above average for his handicap Keep it up 7 Full game planning Nope Just nope Tends to let his playing partners decide his shots which is a recipe for mistakes and regret and we see that with Bobby every video Attitude Priceless Best attitude towards golf Ive seen,0.133,0.724,0.143,-0.2162
